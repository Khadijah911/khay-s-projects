      "Before selecting your desired degree objective on the online application, take a moment to consider your long-term plans.\n",
      "If a PhD is your ultimate degree objective:\n",
      "We recommend you apply for the direct PhD program even if you don’t have an MS degree. The direct PhD option reduces your credit requirements and can accelerate your progress towards the PhD degree. If you choose to do this but your record is not strong enough to merit direct admission into the PhD program, you will automatically be considered for admission to the MS program.\n",
      "If you are seriously considering a PhD degree but you are not yet sure:\n",
      "Selecting the MS program is appropriate.\n",
      "If you are relatively certain that the MS degree is your main objective:\n",
      "Please select the MS program.\n",
      "MS Track Selection\n",
      "Applicants can specify the MS tracks (thesis, project, etc.) they are interested in on the application. However, for residential applicants, space limitations and other considerations may dictate the MS track an applicant is admitted to.\n",

      "Tuition rates for Purdue graduate programs are available\n",
      "here\n",
      ".\n",
      "We award fellowships, research assistantships (RA), and teaching assistantships (TA) to top applicants at the time of admission. Applicants seeking possible funding are cautioned that successful applicants have qualifications that far exceed the minimum/average requirements of GPA and TOEFL.\n",
      "The majority of our funding is offered to students who apply for a Fall start by the December 1 priority date.\n",
      "Very little funding is offered for students who apply for entry in the spring term. See this webpage for additional information about funding:\n",
      "Finding Funding\n",
      ".\n",
      "Fellowships\n",
      "A limited number of outstanding incoming students are offered fellowships each year. The selection of fellowship candidates is based in part on academic record, recommendations, and statement of purpose. Visit this webpage for more information:\n",
      "The Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars Fellowship Office\n",
      ".\n",
      "Teaching Assistantships\n",
      "Teaching Assistantships (TAs) are offered to those graduate students we believe can be especially valuable in helping the faculty carry out the undergraduate teaching mission of ECE. Those chosen must show outstanding evidence of scholarship by both scholastic record and their letters of recommendation.\n",
      "TA positions outside the ECE department are the responsibility of student to apply for.\n",
      "Language proficiency requirements for TAs:\n",
      "Since the language of instruction is English, only those with good oral and written English communication skills are acceptable for ECE TA positions.\n",
      "For international students: TA certified students will be given priority for ECE TA positions.\n",
      "TA certified:\n",
      "To be TA certified, you must meet one of the following criteria:\n",
      "TOEFL speaking score is 27 or higher or your IELTS score is 8 or higher.\n",
      "You have met one of the methods of oral English proficiency described on this webpage: Methods of Oral English Proficiency Certification.\n",
      "Not TA certified:\n",
      "TOEFL score is below 27 or IELTS score is less than 8 (students in this category may be offered conditional TA positions).\n",
      "To become TA certified:\n",
      "You must meet one of the methods of oral English proficiency described on this webpage:\n",
      "Methods of Oral English Proficiency Certification\n",
      ".\n",
      "Research Assistantships\n",
      "Research assistantships (RAs) are supported by research funding made available by the faculty members for whom the research is done.\n",
      "Most RAs are offered after a student has completed at least one semester of course work on the Purdue/West Lafayette campus. This gives the faculty an opportunity to gauge the quality of a student’s academic work before making a research commitment to the student.\n",
      "As would be expected, RAs are more likely to be offered to PhD students than to MS students.\n",
      "Deferring Admission\n",
      "We understand that sometimes events outside your control may require you to request deferral of admission. Please note that deferral is not guaranteed and will be considered only under extenuating circumstances.\n",
      "Students who have been admitted may request to\n",
      "defer their enrollment semester\n",
      "according to the following procedures:\n",
      "Two deferral requests per application.\n",
      "Defer only up to one year.\n",
      "Send an e-mail to the\n",
      "ecegrad@purdue.edu\n",
      "explaining why you need to defer your admission and the term you would like to defer to.\n",
      "Once your deferral is processed (this may take several months as these are processed in batches), you will receive a letter from the OGSPS school with your new start term.\n",
      "If you have been offered funding, your funding may not be guaranteed with your deferral.\n",
      "Reapplication Procedures\n",
      "Students who have been denied admission or whose application was incomplete may reapply for future semesters by completing a new application.\n",
      "Please note:\n",
      "Previous admission does not guarantee future entrance into ECE.\n",
      "Previously denied applicants have only a very slight chance of a positive decision.\n",
      "Transferring Credits\n",
      "For Master's students:\n",
      "Up to 6 credits of graduate-level credits not previously used toward a degree may be transferred toward the Purdue MSECE.\n",
      "For PhD students:\n",
      "Up to 30 credits from the Master's degree may be counted toward the PhD requirements.\n",
